# Fun Little Coding Projects

This repo will contain the starting points for a few different projects to be done in python (or maybe javascript). Most APIs were found using [Public APIs Github Repo](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

The initialy projects that I will try to set up are as follows

1. [Insult Generator](#insult_generator)
1. [Pinball Map](#pinball_map)
1. [Animal Movement Tracker](#animal_movement_tracker)
1. [Art Museum Style Swapper](#art_museum_style_swapper)
1. [City/Country Data Display](#city_country_data_display)

## Projects

### <a name="insult_generator"></a>Insult Generator

This project will use the [Evil Insult Generator API](https://evilinsult.com/api/)

### <a name="pinball_map"></a>Pinball Map

This project will use 2 APIs. The [Pinball Map API](https://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs) and a [Map Generation API](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Cartes.io/wiki/API). It will use the pinball API to get the locations of various pinball machines and display them on an interactive map. 

### <a name="animal_movement_tracker"></a>Animal Movement Tracker

This project will get animal tracking data from [Movebank](https://github.com/movebank/movebank-api-doc), will display the data on a map using [Map Generation API](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Cartes.io/wiki/API), and then will show information about the animal when clicked on by using [FishWatch](https://www.fishwatch.gov/developers) and a similar land based animal API

### <a name="art_museum_style_swapper"></a>Art Museum Style Swapper

This project may not be completed but mainly serves as an idea. This project will involve accessing art in various museums through their APIs ([Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/) for example), and showing 2 pieces side by side. Then an [AI Art Style Transfer API](https://rapidapi.com/hotpot-ai-hotpot/api/ai-art-maker/) will be used to swap the styles.

### <a name="city_country_data_display"></a>City/Country Data Display

This project involves data that comes from a city or country. No idea what it can be used for but an example is the [City of Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/)
